# import-cours-BUT-RT

## What's this repo?

The repository used to store all my classes and class-related documents such as scripts and others.

It also uses [GIT LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) (Large File Storage) system but the storage is not unlimited.
If you add binary files, please do only if it's under ~100 MB per file.

## Install and setup

As this repository uses submodules, when trying to clone the repository use this command:

- using SSH:

  ```sh
  git clone --recursive git@github.com:alexis-opolka/import-cours-but-rt.git
  ```

- using HTTPS:

  ```sh
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/alexis-opolka/import-cours-but-rt.git
  ```

After having successfully cloned the repository, you might not see all the files such as PDFs, it's normal, as we use GIT LFS you need to pull the remaining files.

```sh
git lfs pull
```

Now you're ready to code ! Happy to count you onboard ! :smile:
