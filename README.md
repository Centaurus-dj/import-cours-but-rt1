# import-cours-BUT-RT

## What's this repo?

The repository used to store all my classes and class-related documents such as scripts and others.

It also uses [GIT LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) (Large File Storage) system but the storage is not unlimited.
If you add binary files, please do only if it's under ~100 MB per file.

This project was made to help students in the Networks and Telecommunications field at the IUT of BÃ©ziers, so
if you've been helped by this repository, please think of supporting this project either by supporting me
(this lets me have more time to work on this project) or by contributing classes or ressources in this repository.

## Install and setup
