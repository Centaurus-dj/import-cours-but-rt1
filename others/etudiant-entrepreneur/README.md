# Etudiant-Entrepreneur

## About

This is the folder used for any content related to my Student-Entrepreneur status
and project. You'll be able to find taken notes from Webinairs, reflexions, occasionally some
research papers on some subjects related to my project directly or indirectly.

## Why

I think that in order for both the entrepreneurship mindset and the leveraging of required skills
to be growing and become more popular it needs to start with both energy (from someone) and transparency.

So, to stay true to my words written above, I'm going to keep the most acceptable transparency on things
such as administrative tasks, project-related ideas and research, and even some meetings.

Following the license of this repository, everything made public under this repository and, more specifically,
under this folder will be released into the public domain mainly for educational purposes.
