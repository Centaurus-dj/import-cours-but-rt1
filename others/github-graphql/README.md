## About

The GitHub GraphQL folder is a folder used for one of my projects to
create an easy to use Python module to call and receive data from the GitHub
GraphQL API.

It should comport:

- CLI commands (from the Python module?)
- Python module
- Output:
  - JSON (machine-friendly)
  - YAML (human-friendly)
