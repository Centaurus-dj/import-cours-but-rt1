    ```txt
    I am a Student-Entrepreneur (https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/statut-national-etudiant-entrepreneur-46412)
    and I am currently the Co-President of a non-profit association called Heimdall consisting of pro-active members of the student
    life on the student campus of Béziers, France.
    It aims to revitalize the current campus with cultural activities, workshops and conferences.
    It also aims to close the gap between the professionals and the students by supporting student initiatives and making
    companies closer to students. Its duration is set at 50 years starting from the day of its declaration, it is currently
    in progress of being declared to the administration of Béziers and should be recognized as a moral entity in mid-september at the latest.

    While not being called Heimdall and not being set on creating a non-profit association, the founding members, including me,
    successfully helped to create a board games club which is currently administered by one of those members who is also
    part of the student association, due to legal obligations.
    Moreover, it has already met its audience inside the University Institute of Technology, which shows us there is room to grow
    such activities and there is a number of students that are missing those.

   - Share details about the events your community have organized in the past year. Please provide links to your community's online presence where we can further explore its activities and initiatives.

    ```txt
    Since the project of the Heimdall Non-Profit Association is younger than a year and the legal entity is on its way to
    become reality, it is quite difficult to present any public project as the work of its community since it wasn't even a thing.
    It should also be noted that the founding members of the association were each working on their project under their own name
    and not under the name of the Heimdall Association.

    Here is the link of the instagram of the current student association: https://www.instagram.com/aeiutbeziers/
    It is one of the communities we want to help grow and complement in the areas they are
    lacking or struggling to get a correct foothold to start stable and more inclusive actions troughout the student campus.

   - Can you tell us about a time when you took the lead in your community to address a challenge? Please share the outcome, and how you would leverage your experience and the resources provided by the GitHub Campus Experts program to handle current or future obstacles.

    ```txt
    While I was in High-School, there was a clear need of separation between the student association and the Student Life Council
    (or "Conseil de la Vie Lycéenne" in french), furthermore the student association, at that time, was unstable due to multiple
    resignations and short mandates of the people in charge of the association. I decided to apply to the function of President
    and was successfully elected at the position. Following two years of work, the student association was more stable and less
    prompt to people resignating from their position one or two months after being elected and there was a clear distinction
    between both organisations on what each one had to do. Moreover, the association, during my mandate, gained an administrative and financial
    stability and was able to make events and proceed with certain projects during the COVID-19 pandemic in France.


    I would leverage my experience and the resources provided by the GitHub Campus Experts program to handle the current necessity
    of introducing intelectual events open to anyone, support student initiatives through workshops or any appropriate form of support,
    as well as empowering students in an inclusive community.
    At the time I'm writing this application, at my initiative, I have nearly finished preparing workshops and conferences on Git, GitHub
    Projects and GitHub Actions made for beginner and intermediate levels. Since most people studying in an IT cursus either
    uses GitHub or at least knows of the company, the resources provided by GitHub will be of great help in creating the momentum and
    the interest required to tackle the most important issues in the span of two years, at most.
