| > [file] <br> 2>&1 <hr> &> [file]   | Redirect *stdout* and *stderr* to overwrite the same file         | ![redirection-combine-overwrite](./src/rh124/chapter-4/combine-overwrite.svg "Redirection and combine then overwrite")   |
| >> [file] <br> 2>&1 <hr> &>> [file] | Redirect *stdout* and *stderr* to append to the same file         | ![redirection-combine-append](./src/rh124/chapter-4/combine-append.svg "Redirection and combine then append")            |

#### Noteworthy examples

The order of redirection operations is important.
The following sequence redirects standard output to the *output.log* file
and then redirects standard error messages to the same place as standard output *(output.log)*.

```sh
 > output.log 2>&1
```

The next sequence does redirection in the opposite order.
This sequence redirects standard error messages to the default place for standard output
(the terminal window, so no change) and then redirects only standard output to *output.log*.

```sh
 2>&1 > output.log
```

For this reason, some people prefer to use the merging redirection operators:

```sh
&> output.log instead of > output.log 2>&1
```

```sh
&>> output.log instead of >> output.log 2>&1   # (in Bash 4 / RHEL 6 and later)
```

However, system administrators and programmers who also use other related shells to bash
(known as Bourne-compatible shells) for scripting commands prefer to avoid the newer merging
redirection operators, because they are not standardized or implemented in all of those shells
and have other limitations.

#### Pipeline Examples with the tee Command

The next example redirects the output of the ls command to the */tmp/saved-output* file and passes it to the less command,
so it is displayed on the terminal one screen at a time.

```sh
[user@host ~]$ ls -l | tee /tmp/saved-output | less
```

If you use the tee command at the end of a pipeline,
then the terminal shows the output of the commands in the pipeline and saves it to a file at the same time.

```sh
[user@host ~]$ ls -t | head -n 10 | tee /tmp/ten-last-changed-files
```

Use the tee command `-a` option to append the content to a file instead of overwriting it.

```sh
[user@host ~]$ ls -l | tee -a /tmp/append-files
```

Important
You can redirect standard error through a pipeline, but you cannot use the merging redirection operators (`&>` and `&>>`).  
The following example is the correct way to redirect both standard output and standard error through a pipeline:

```sh
[user@host ~]$ find -name / passwd 2>&1 | less
```
