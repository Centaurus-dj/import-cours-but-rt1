# R311 - Autonomous drones

## What can they become in the future?

What a vague question because we can't predict what the technologies
of tomorrow wil be and what our society will evolve into.
Therefore, only our imagination is the limit of what drones can become in the future.

- Explore future: dystopian, mostly

- New technologies:
  - Submarine drones
  - Spatial drones
  - Nano-drones (mostly in medical field)
  - Generative AI into drones
