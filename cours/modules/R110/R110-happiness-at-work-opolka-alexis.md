The article: [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisonescalante/2020/11/17/your-job-satisfaction-may-have-more-to-do-with-who-you-work-with-than-what-you-do/?sh=ba1fa9a7b87e)

The article of Forbes is pretty much the same as the video in the quiz.\
We understand in both that more money does not make us happier and the most important is what was called the four S: Social, Structure, Stimulation and Story.\
The social in the interaction between people, preferably friendly discussions or interactions, in the article it's said that bosses and coworkers are a big source of stress, it is then important to have
good relations with our coworkers and bosses as it's a part of what's fulfilling our desire of happiness in life.\
The structure is not explicitely talked of, in the article, but it's clearly important in order to have a stable daily life and a work-life balance.\
The stimulation is "quoted" in a way by Forbes as it's the interest in the job and in the workplace, without interest we can't find hapiness as we aren't searching for it or doesn't make any effort in order to find it.
The story is talked about in both and once again using another word, in Forbes we talk about being valued rather than the story of what we're doing, contributing to.
In a nutshell, the core thing of being valued or what we're contributing to is the fact that we don't feel useless and, in a way it's a bit selfish but, that what we did could not be done without us.
